# ionFOAM
This code was used for the study titled "Determination of Forced Convection Effects on the Response of Ion Selective Electrodes via Numerical Solution to the Navier-Stokes-Nernst-Plank-Poisson Equations"
# installation
This code can be compiled similar to how OpenFOAM is compiled, refer to https://openfoam.org/download/source/compiling-openfoam/ for more details on how to compile OpenFOAM from source code. The "ionFOAM" source resides in applications/solvers/ionFOAM and should be automatically compiled with the Allwmake script. The solver can then be accessed by typing "ionFoam" into the commandline.
